This repository has all the stuff related to OnlineATV


## How the server works

The server is 3 things.
1. An RTMP server (ex. MediaMTX)
2. A hosting (I use playit.gg, but you can also port forward)
3. An FTP/HTTP server to put the IP on. (ex. ProFreeHost)

And with those 3 things, you'll be able to host and customize your own version of OnlineATV.

## The client

I made the client so you can easily watch OnlineATV streams (channels).
See [/OnlineATV Client/README.md](https://github.com/MarkPCExpertYT/OnlineATV/blob/master/OnlineATV%20Client/README.md) for info about the client
