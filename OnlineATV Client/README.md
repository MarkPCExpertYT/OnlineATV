# OnlineATV Client

### A client to easily watch OnlineATV streams

I made this so you don't have to manually type in the IP of channels when you want to watch them, and also just kind of a LibVLC test.

## Current Features (v1.5.0)

- Watching OnlineATV Streams
- Auto-get IP and port
- Channel selection
- Selecting channel by number keys
- Custom URL's
- Fullscreen mode
- Playback status
- Hiding info bar
- How-to dialog for streaming to OnlineATV
- Noise when no channel is selected and when buffering (can be turned off)
- Volume control
- Stopping and restarting playback

Note: Press ALT to show the menu bar
